    <h3>Crusty, Rustic Sourdough</h3>
    <p>Imagine sinking your teeth into a loaf of freshly baked sourdough, where the deep, crackling crust gives way to a tender, airy interior. 
        The aroma of natural fermentation fills the room, mingling with subtle notes of tang and earthiness that hint at a slow, artisanal process. 
        Each slice reveals a mosaic of delicate bubbles, the perfect balance of rustic charm and modern craftsmanship, promising a delightful chew and a burst of flavor in every bite.</p>

    <p>This sourdough masterpiece is not merely bread—it's an experience. 
        Its complex flavor profile, with a whisper of acidity and the warmth of a golden crust, invites you to savor every moment. 
        Whether enjoyed on its own, drizzled with olive oil, or paired with your favorite spread, each mouthful transports you to a cozy bakery filled with tradition and passion, making every meal an indulgent celebration of taste.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>500g bread flour (plus extra for dusting)</li>
        <li>350g water (room temperature)</li>
        <li>100g active sourdough starter (fed and bubbly)</li>
        <li>10g salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><h4>Autolyse</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    In a large bowl, combine the flour and water. 
                    Mix until no dry spots remain, cover, and let it rest for 30 minutes. 
                    This process hydrates the flour and develops gluten.
                </li>   
            </ul>
        </li> 
        <li> <h4>Mix in Starter & Salt:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Add the active sourdough starter and salt. Mix well until fully incorporated. 
                    You can use your hands to gently fold and knead the dough until it’s smooth.</li>            </ul>
        </li>
        <li> <h4>Bulk Fermentation & Stretch & Folds:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Cover the bowl with a damp towel or plastic wrap. Let the dough rest at room temperature for about 4–5 hours. 
                    During the first 2 hours, perform a set of stretch and folds every 30 minutes (4 sets total) to strengthen the dough.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li> <h4>Pre-Shape & Rest:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Once the bulk fermentation is complete, gently turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and pre-shape it into a loose ball. 
                    Let it rest for 20–30 minutes.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li> <h4>Final Shape & Proof:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Shape the dough into a tighter ball or oval. Place it seam-side up in a well-floured proofing basket (banneton). 
                    Cover and let it proof at room temperature for 1–2 hours, or for better flavor and structure, refrigerate overnight (8–12 hours).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li> <h4>Preheat & Prepare for Baking:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>About 30 minutes before baking, preheat your oven to 500°F (260°C) with a Dutch oven (or heavy covered pot) inside. 
                    This creates the steam needed for a crispy crust.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li> <h4>Score & Bake:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Carefully transfer your cold dough onto a piece of parchment paper. 
                    Gently flip it so the seam side is down, then score the top with a sharp knife or lame. 
                    Lower the oven temperature to 450°F (230°C), place the dough (with the parchment) into the Dutch oven, cover, and bake for 20 minutes.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li> <h4>Finish Baking:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Remove the lid, and continue baking for an additional 20–25 minutes until the crust is a deep golden brown and the loaf sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li> <h4>Cool & Enjoy:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Transfer the bread to a cooling rack and let it cool completely before slicing. 
                    This final rest allows the crumb to set and the flavors to mature.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
